  help="A command-line tool for safely unmounting mounted devices from $MOUNT_DIR/<mountpoint>.

Usage:

  $(basename "$0") <mountpoint>

Arguments:

  mountpoint         The name of the mount directory inside $MOUNT_DIR (e.g., mydrive).

Options:

  --help             Show this help message and exit.

Examples:

- Unmount $MOUNT_DIR/usb:
  $(basename "$0") usb

- Unmount $MOUNT_DIR/mydrive and all nested mounts (recursive unmount):
  $(basename "$0") mydrive

Notes:
 - This script checks if the given path is an actual mountpoint before unmounting.
 - Uses recursive unmount (-R) in case there are nested mounts under the mountpoint.
 - Requires sudo access to perform unmounting.
