  help="A command-line tool for safely unmounting Android MTP devices from $MOUNT_DIR/<mountpoint>.

Usage:
    $(basename "$0") <mountpoint>

Arguments:
    mountpoint     The name of the mount directory inside $MOUNT_DIR (e.g., myphone).

Options:
    --help         Show this help message and exit.

Examples:
    • Unmount an Android device mounted at $MOUNT_DIR/phone:
        $(basename "$0") phone

Notes:
    • This script verifies that the given path is an active mountpoint before unmounting.
    • Uses recursive unmount (-R) to handle cases with nested mounts.
    • Requires sudo access to perform the unmount operation.
