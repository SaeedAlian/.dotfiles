  help="dumount: A command-line tool for safely unmounting mounted devices from $MOUNT_DIR/<mountpoint>.

Usage:

  dumount <mountpoint>

Arguments:

  mountpoint         The name of the mount directory inside $MOUNT_DIR (e.g., mydrive).

Options:

  --help             Show this help message and exit.

Examples:

• Unmount $MOUNT_DIR/usb:
  dumount usb

• Unmount $MOUNT_DIR/mydrive and all nested mounts (recursive unmount):
  dumount mydrive

Notes:
 • This script checks if the given path is an actual mountpoint before unmounting.
 • Uses recursive unmount (-R) in case there are nested mounts under the mountpoint.
 • Requires sudo access to perform unmounting.
