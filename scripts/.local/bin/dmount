  help="dmount: A command-line tool for safely mounting devices to $MOUNT_DIR/<mountpoint> with user ownership.

Usage:

  dmount <device_name> <mountpoint>

Arguments:

  device_name        The device name without /dev/ prefix (e.g., sdb1).

  mountpoint         The name of the mount directory inside $MOUNT_DIR (e.g., mydrive).

Options:

  --help             Show this help message and exit.

Examples:

• Mount /dev/sdb1 to $MOUNT_DIR/usb:
  dmount sdb1 usb

• Automatically create $MOUNT_DIR/mydrive and mount /dev/sdc1 with user access:
  dmount sdc1 mydrive

Notes:
 • This script checks if the device is already mounted or if the mountpoint is in use.
 • The mounted filesystem will be owned by the current user (UID=$(id -u), GID=$(id -g)).
 • Requires sudo access to perform mounting.
 • Automatically creates the mountpoint directory if it doesn't exist.
