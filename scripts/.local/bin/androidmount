  help="androidmount: A command-line tool for safely mounting Android devices over MTP to $MOUNT_DIR/<mountpoint> with user ownership.

Usage:
    androidmount <mountpoint>

Arguments:
    mountpoint     The name of the mount directory inside $MOUNT_DIR (e.g., myphone).

Options:
    --help         Show this help message and exit.

Examples:
    • Mount an Android device to $MOUNT_DIR/phone:
        androidmount phone

    • Automatically create $MOUNT_DIR/myandroid and mount the device:
        androidmount myandroid

Notes:
    • This script uses 'aft-mtp-mount' to mount Android devices over MTP.
    • The mountpoint directory will be created if it does not exist.
    • The script checks if the mountpoint is already in use before mounting.
